// src/lib/savingsHabit.ts
// Pay-yourself-first habit tracking: how many months in a row the borrower kept back at least
// their own savings target. Pure, unit-tested, no UI or DB imports.
//
// PURE MOTIVATION, NOT A CREDIT SIGNAL. Like `streak.ts`, nothing here reaches `creditScore.ts`,
// `dataConfidence.ts` or any loan decision, and it must stay that way. Real surplus already
// reaches the score through the cashflow and savings-rate factors, computed from the ledger. A
// target is something the borrower sets for themselves, so scoring it would reward setting a low
// one, and rewarding a self-set number is exactly the kind of gameable signal the rest of this
// codebase is built to avoid.
//
// WHY MONTHS AND NOT DAYS. EPF and AKPK both frame the habit as a fixed set-aside each time
// income lands, and the target user is paid irregularly rather than daily, so the month is the
// smallest unit where "did you keep any of it" is a meaningful question.

 * reset the count to zero on the 1st of every month.
