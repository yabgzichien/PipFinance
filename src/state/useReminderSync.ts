// src/state/useReminderSync.ts
// Keeps the scheduled local reminders in step with the data they are about.
//
// lib/reminders.ts plans a ladder of one-shot notifications rather than one repeating trigger
// (see the header there for why), which means something has to re-arm the ladder. This is that
// something: it re-plans on mount, whenever the app returns to the foreground, and whenever
// the inputs change  so saving a transaction immediately pushes tonight's nudge out to
// tomorrow, and settling the last debt cancels the chase.
//
// Follows the AppState pattern from useLenderSyncPoll.ts, minus the interval. There is nothing
// arriving from outside to poll for here: the plan only changes when the user does something,
// and every one of those somethings already re-renders this hook.
