// There is a sibling index.web.ts that no-ops every export. Metro resolves the .web.ts on
// `expo export --platform web`, which is what keeps expo-notifications (no web support) out of
// the Vercel bundle entirely. A runtime `Platform.OS` check would not: the import would still
// be resolved and shipped.
